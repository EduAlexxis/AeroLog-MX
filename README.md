## ✈️ About AeroLog

**AeroLog** is a professional utility application re-engineered for the modern hangar floor. It streamlines the process of logging inventory, tracking parts, and documenting maintenance actions without the clutter of legacy systems.

Built natively for both iOS and Android, AeroLog moves beyond simple data entry. It integrates **On-Device Computer Vision** to instantly capture part data and ensures high-speed performance even in environments with zero connectivity.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🔍 Intelligent Scanner** | Powered by native Vision frameworks, the scanner instantly extracts Part Numbers (PN) from messy tags using OCR. |
| **☁️ Zero-Knowledge Sync** | **(iOS Only)** Built on **CloudKit**. Your data lives in your personal iCloud Private Database. |
| **💾 Import/Export** | **(Android Exclusive)** Full database control. Export your logs to a file or import backups to keep your data portable. |
| **📸 Visual Evidence** | Attach high-resolution photos of tags and parts directly to your log entries for full accountability. |
| **⚡️ Offline Capable** | AeroLog works flawlessly in hangars with no Wi-Fi. Data is stored locally and stays accessible. |
| **🛡 Ad-Free & Private** | No tracking. No analytics. No ads. Just a professional tool for professionals. |

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

AeroLog utilizes a **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**. We believe your maintenance logs are your property.

- **No Developer Access:** We do not operate a backend server. We physically cannot access your logs.
- **Private Data:** On iOS, synchronization occurs via your private iCloud container. On Android, your data remains local until you choose to export it.
- **Local Processing:** All processing (OCR, Image storage) happens on-device.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

AeroLog is built using modern technologies to ensure longevity and performance across platforms.

- **iOS/iPadOS:** SwiftUI, SwiftData, CloudKit, Vision Framework.
- **Android:** Native development with local SQLite/Room architecture for high-speed offline logging.
- **OCR:** Native on-device Optical Character Recognition.
